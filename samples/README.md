# Sample Chat Modules

Complete, installable example modules for ZAgents. Each folder is a
ready-to-package module demonstrating one slice of the official SDK —
see [`../docs/modules/`](../docs/modules/) for the full reference and
[`../sdk/`](../sdk/) for the SDK itself.

| Sample | Permissions | Demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| [`counter/`](counter/) | `storage` | Per-chat key/value store — the counter restarts at zero in every other chat (private-window isolation) |
| [`network-fetcher/`](network-fetcher/) | `network`, `chat` | `zagents.http.request` through the app transport, restricted by a manifest `allowedHosts` allowlist (`api.github.com` only) |
| [`file-notes/`](file-notes/) | `files` | Sandboxed filesystem under the per-chat `state/` directory: mkdir / appendFile / readFile / readdir / stat |
| [`chat-streamer/`](chat-streamer/) | `chat` | Progressive output into the conversation with `zagents.chat.emit` |
| [`onhomeroom-daily/`](onhomeroom-daily/) | `storage`, `network`, `agent` | Real-world daily bot for app.onhomeroom.com — challenge board, yes votes, chat replies, proposal pipeline. Every sentence is composed live by the chat agent via `zagents.agent.compose` (no templates). The app collects the account with a per-chat setup form before the first run (`zagents.info.setup`); text commands (`setup <email> <password>`, `status`, `reset`) still re-configure an already set-up chat |
| [`airplane-mode/`](airplane-mode/) | `device` | Android airplane mode + carrier IP rotation: **CYCLE** — the one-command IP rotation `/airplane cycle` (aliases `ip`, `rotate`) via `zagents.device.airplaneCycle` (v1.34.0): airplane ON → hold → OFF → settle; the radio re-registers with a NEW IP and the cycle always ends OFF/online (rooted, needs the "Device commands (root)" switch). **AUTO** toggle via `zagents.device.shell` (`su -c`) on rooted phones, **MANUAL** guided mode on non-rooted ones — the state is always verified with the world-readable `zagents.device.airplane` probe (no root, works offline). Driven by the `/airplane cycle \| on \| off \| status` slash commands — the manifest `commands` field routes the message to the module instead of the LLM, and the commands keep working while airplane mode is ON |
| [`evm-wallet/`](evm-wallet/) | `storage`, `network`, `chat` | Full per-chat EVM wallet via `/wallet` slash commands: GENERATE-ONLY accounts (fresh random key per chat — no import, no seed phrases, aligned with the app's Web3 red lines), EIP-55 checksum addresses, native + ERC-20 balances, gas price, 10 verified networks (Ethereum, Sepolia, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, OP Mainnet + 3 testnets; default Sepolia), and EIP-155 signed transfers (pure-JS Keccak-256 / secp256k1 / RFC 6979 / RLP, zero npm deps) with a mandatory two-step confirm — `/wallet send` prints the FULL summary, `/wallet confirm` signs + broadcasts, `/wallet cancel` discards. Allowlist-restricted JSON-RPC via `zagents.http`; the canonical EIP-155 spec vector is reproduced byte-for-byte in the module test harness |
| [`web-browser/`](web-browser/) | `network` (unrestricted), `storage`, `chat` | Text-mode web browser via `/web`: reader-mode extraction of any URL (script/style/nav stripped, `<article>/<main>` preferred, headings + bullets kept), numbered link tables with `/web goto <n>`, pagination (`/web more`), navigation history, raw JSON preview, and 5-engine search with fallbacks (DuckDuckGo Lite/HTML → Mojeek → Wikipedia → DuckDuckGo Instant Answers). Staged messages act as an address bar (URL-shaped → open, else → search). The unrestricted network scope IS the browser; everything else stays per-chat |
| [`rss-reader/`](rss-reader/) | `network` (unrestricted), `storage`, `chat` | Per-chat RSS/Atom reader via `/rss`: tolerant regex parser for RSS 2.0 + Atom (CDATA, namespaces, `link@href@alternate`, relative links), subscriptions with unread counts, merged newest-first digest, refresh reporting only NEW items against a per-chat `seen` map (LRU-trimmed), two-step unsubscribe |
| [`qr-tools/`](qr-tools/) | *(none)* | Real, scannable QR codes as Unicode half-block art via `/qr` — zero permissions, fully offline. Complete pure-JS encoder: byte mode, versions 1-25, Reed-Solomon over GF(256), block interleaving, format/version BCH bits, all 8 masks with spec penalty scoring. Matrices verified **cell-for-cell identical** to Nayuki's reference library and 9/9 round-trip decoded by OpenCV (including multi-block v14-v19 + UTF-8). `/qr wifi ssid | pass` builds WIFI: payloads |
| [`totp-auth/`](totp-auth/) | `storage` | Per-chat RFC 6238 authenticator via `/otp`: pure-JS SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512 + HMAC + Base32, all 18 official RFC 6238 vectors pass, 6-8 digits / 15-120 s periods, `otpauth://` export that pairs with `/qr`, two-step removal. NO network permission — secrets cannot leave the device |
| [`csv-data/`](csv-data/) | `storage` | CSV analysis studio via `/csv`: RFC 4180 parser (quoted fields, embedded commas/newlines, `,`/`;`/tab auto-detection), per-column type inference, stats (min/max/mean/median/std/uniques), numeric-aware sort/filter, frequency tops, ASCII bar charts + histograms, 6-hour-cached nothing — fully offline. Datasets ≤56 KB per chat |
| [`converters/`](converters/) | `network` (allowlisted), `storage` | Currency + units via `/cur` and `/unit`: live mid-market rates from open.er-api.com (no key) locked by the manifest allowlist with a 6-hour per-chat cache, friendly aliases (rupiah, euro, yen…), plus an OFFLINE unit engine across 8 categories (length/mass/data/speed/volume/area/time/temperature) with plural, symbol and squashed-input aliases |
| [`facebook-page/`](facebook-page/) | `network` (allowlisted: graph.facebook.com), `storage`, `agent`, `chat` | Fanspage assistant via `/fb`: "auto-login" with a Page Access Token collected by the per-chat setup form (validated against Graph API `/me`, stored per chat, never logged), auto-reply to Messenger messages AND post comments through `zagents.agent.polish` — 8 built-in template families (greeting/question/price/shipping/thanks/complaint/generic/away, 1-4 variants each, `{name}`/`{page}` slots) rewritten live by the chat's own LLM into natural, human-sounding replies in the sender's language, keyword intent classifier (ID+EN), randomized human-like delays, seen-ID dedupe (replies never fire twice), burst auto-watch (`/fb auto`), speed presets, per-channel on/off toggles, template editor, two-step-friendly logout |
| [`twitter-x/`](twitter-x/) | `network` (allowlisted: api.x.com, api.twitter.com), `storage`, `agent`, `chat` | X/Twitter assistant via `/tw`: OAuth 1.0a user keys from the per-chat setup form (pure-JS HMAC-SHA1 signer verified against the official X docs worked example), auto-reply to mentions through `zagents.agent.polish` with template families + AI polish in the sender's language, keyword intent classifier, human-like delays, seen-ID dedupe with failure backoff, burst auto-watch (`/tw auto`), manual `/tw tweet` + `/tw reply`, template editor, honest tier handling (Free = posting only; reads need Basic) |

## Ready-made ZIPs — download and install directly

Every sample also ships pre-packaged **next to its folder** as
`<name>.zip` (`counter.zip`, `network-fetcher.zip`, `file-notes.zip`,
`chat-streamer.zip`, `onhomeroom-daily.zip`, `airplane-mode.zip`,
`evm-wallet.zip`, `web-browser.zip`, `rss-reader.zip`, `qr-tools.zip`,
`totp-auth.zip`, `csv-data.zip`, `converters.zip`, `facebook-page.zip`,
`twitter-x.zip`).
Download one, then install
it via **Settings → Modules → Install module** — no packaging needed.
A test guards these archives: each `<name>.zip` must always match its
folder exactly, so they can never silently go stale. To rebuild one by
hand, see the packaging section below.

## Package a sample into an installable ZIP

The app installs modules from ZIP archives. From the repository root:

```bash
# Flat layout (module.json at the ZIP root):
cd samples/counter && zip -r ../../hello-counter.zip . && cd ../..

# or zip the FOLDER — the app unwraps a single top-level directory
# automatically (same layout as a GitHub "Download ZIP"):
cd samples && zip -r ../counter.zip counter && cd ..
```

On Windows: right-click the sample folder → *Send to → Compressed
(zipped) folder* — both layouts install fine.

## Install and run

1. ZAgents app → **Settings → Modules → Install module** → pick the ZIP.
2. Start a chat, then either:
   - type **`/plugins`** and pick the module from the interactive menu,
   - type **`/plugins hello-counter`** (module `name` from the manifest),
   - or tap the module chip on the new-chat screen.
3. Approve the requested permissions in the activation dialog.
4. Modules that declare a `setup` block (onhomeroom-daily) show a
   per-chat setup form first — fill it once and the module runs right
   after; other chats ask again by design.
5. The module runs once: console output and the return value are posted
   into the conversation with a module badge; the agent can read and
   discuss them.

## Expected output highlights

* `hello-counter` — run it twice in the same chat: the count goes
  1 → 2. Open a different chat and run it again: it starts from 1.
  That difference *is* the per-chat isolation guarantee.
* `network-fetcher` — posts the fetched quote into the conversation;
  editing the code to hit another host fails with
  `Host is not allowed by this module (allowedHosts)`.
* `file-notes` — every activation appends one timestamp line to
  `state/notes/session.txt`; the file lives per chat and per module.
* `chat-streamer` — three step messages appear progressively while the
  module runs.
* `onhomeroom-daily` — after the per-chat setup form (email + password),
  one cycle per activation: challenge board lines, yes votes, at most one
  composed text per run, a run summary line. Run it in two chats with two
  different accounts and the sessions never mix.
* `airplane-mode` — type `/airplane status` (or `on` / `off`) in a chat:
  the module runs directly (no LLM turn) and reports the verified
  airplane state. Rooted phones toggle automatically; non-rooted phones
  get the guided MANUAL steps (flip the radio in Quick Settings, then
  re-run `/airplane status` — the probe verifies the real state, a bare
  "yes" is never trusted). `/airplane cycle` (v1.3, aliases `ip` /
  `rotate`) rotates the carrier IP in ONE command: airplane ON → hold →
  OFF → settle, verified, always ends OFF — online with a fresh IP. The
  commands keep working while airplane mode is ON; when the radio comes
  back, auto-retry continues the chat.
* `evm-wallet` — `/wallet create` mints a fresh per-chat account (testnet
  by default); `/wallet send 0x… 0.05` prints the full transaction
  summary and waits: `/wallet confirm` signs with the chat's own key and
  broadcasts (hash + explorer link), `/wallet cancel` discards, and a
  pending offer never survives a network switch. Balances, gas price,
  ERC-20 tokens and receipts are read from the allowlisted public RPCs.
